AI-assisted coding reduced the average time-to-shipped-product from months to weeks. The result: thousands of technically excellent products are sitting on domains that nobody knows about, built by people who are genuinely talented at making things and genuinely terrible at telling people those things exist.\n     6→\n     7→The distribution gap is not new. But it has widened dramatically. Building got 10x easier while distribution stayed exactly as hard as it ever was.

The product has been live for three weeks. The Stripe dashboard still reads $0.00. The founder has twelve r/Entrepreneur tabs open and hasn't actually posted anything anywhere.

They're failing because the gap between \"I know I should post on Reddit\" and \"I actually post on Reddit\" is larger than it looks.\n    27→\n    28→That gap is filled with: Which subreddit? What do I say? Will it sound like spam? Is it okay to mention my product? What if nobody responds? What if it gets downvoted? What do I do after I post?\n    29→\n    30→Each of these micro-decisions creates a decision point where the founder can bail back into research mode. The research loop is not stupidity — it is a rational response to ambiguity in a domain the founder has never operated in before. \"I spent three months building a product nobody asked for, then another two months 'researching' how to sell it\" is a documented failure pattern, not an edge case.\n    31→\n    32→**What current solutions do:** Tell the founder what to do. Courses, playbooks, books, threads — they all add information. Information is not the constraint. Decision-making under uncertainty in an unfamiliar domain is the constraint.\n    33→\n    34→### Pain 2: Zero-Signal Paralysis\n    35→\n    36→The hardest thing about having zero users is not the revenue — it's the uncertainty. A product with zero users might be a brilliant product that nobody knows about, or it might be something nobody wants. The founder cannot know which until they get signal. But getting signal requires distribution. Distribution requires making decisions in a domain the founder doesn't understand. And so the founder waits.\n    37→\n    38→This is a loop with no natural exit. The product gets better — new features, polished UI, improved onboarding — but zero users means zero signal means continued uncertainty means continued paralysis.\n    39→\n    40→**The real job to be done:** Break the loop. Get signal. Find out if this thing has legs — within 48 hours, not 6 months.\n    41→\n    42→### Pain 3: The Credibility Paradox\n    43→\n    44→Reddit (and most communities where ICPs hang out) rewards authentic community members and punishes obvious self-promoters. The founder who posts \"check out my product\" gets downvoted. The founder who finds a thread where someone is asking exactly the question their product answers, writes a genuinely helpful response, and mentions their product in passing — that founder gets users.\n    45→\n    46→Most technical founders know this. They cannot execute it because:\n    47→1. Finding the right thread requires 30-90 minutes of scrolling Reddit before finding something relevant (and often finding nothing)\n    48→2. Writing a response that is genuinely helpful AND naturally introduces the product is a learned skill they don't have\n    49→3. Even when they find the thread and draft something, the activation energy to hit \"submit\" is surprisingly high — \"what if this seems like spam?\"\n    50→\n    51→**Current solutions fail here:** ChatGPT can draft content but cannot find live, relevant threads in real-time. Reddit search is poor. Tools like Syften provide keyword alerts but don't help with content creation.

They don't post from managed accounts. They don't automate. They hit paste from their own profile.\n    77→\n    78→**Why \"launch sprint\" not \"distribution tool\":** The job is one-time. Getting your first 10 users is not an ongoing subscription — it's a discrete event. The founder who has zero users needs to know if their product has legs. One sprint, 48 hours, real signal. After that they either have users and a clearer picture of what distribution works, or they have kill data and can move on. Neither outcome benefits from a monthly subscription.\n    79→\n    80→---\n    81→\n    82→## Why Current Solutions Fail\n    83→\n    84→### ChatGPT + Manual (free — the real competitor)\n    85→\n    86→A technically sophisticated founder can approximate this workflow with ChatGPT for free. The gap between \"use ChatGPT\" and \"use this tool\" is real but narrow:\n    87→\n    88→- **ChatGPT cannot find live threads.** Its knowledge cutoff means it cannot search Reddit for posts from the past 7 days. The founder still has to manually find relevant threads — which is the hardest part. The tool can do this automatically.\n    89→- **ChatGPT does not know subreddit norms.** r/SaaS, r/Entrepreneur, r/SideProject, r/startups all have distinct cultures, norms, and tolerance for self-promotion. Content that works on one gets downvoted on another. The tool is trained on what actually works in each community.\n    90→- **ChatGPT requires prompting skill.** \"Write me a Reddit comment for a SaaS product\" produces generic garbage. \"Here is the thread, here is the product, write something that directly answers the OP's question in the tone of r/SaaS, mentions the product in the third paragraph, and avoids the phrase 'game-changer'\" produces something usable. The tool abstracts this prompting.\n    91→\n    92→**But the gap is narrow.** This is a genuine risk. The tool must be meaningfully better than a competent founder with a good ChatGPT prompt — not marginally better.\n    93→\n    94→### Reddit Marketing Tools (paid — the nominal competitors)\n    95→\n    96→**ReplyAgent / OGTool / CrowdReply:** These are spam machines. They post via managed karma accounts at scale ($3/comment or volume-based). The content is detectable. Reddit communities have become extremely good at identifying AI-generated promotional comments. These tools train communities to be hostile to any founder doing authentic outreach.

The product has been live for three weeks. The Stripe dashboard still reads $0.00. The founder has twelve r/Entrepreneur tabs open and hasn't actually posted anything anywhere. They tell themselves they're \"still figuring out the strategy.\" They are not figuring out the strategy. They are afraid to find out if anyone cares.\n\n**Secondary (higher willingness to pay):** The founder with early revenue ($100-5k MRR) who got their first users through luck, referrals, or a one-time viral moment — and now needs to systematize distribution to grow without hiring a marketer.\n\n---\n\n## The Pain\n\n### Pain 1: The Research Loop\n\nThe founder is not failing because they don't know distribution exists. They're failing because the gap between \"I know I should post on Reddit\" and \"I actually post on Reddit\" is larger than it looks.\n\nThat gap is filled with: Which subreddit? What do I say? Will it sound like spam? Is it okay to mention my product? What if nobody responds? What if it gets downvoted? What do I do after I post?\n\nEach of these micro-decisions creates a decision point where the founder can bail back into research mode. The research loop is not stupidity — it is a rational response to ambiguity in a domain the founder has never operated in before. \"I spent three months building a product nobody asked for, then another two months 'researching' how to sell it\" is a documented failure pattern, not an edge case.\n\n**What current solutions do:** Tell the founder what to do. Courses, playbooks, books, threads — they all add information. Information is not the constraint. Decision-making under uncertainty in an unfamiliar domain is the constraint.\n\n### Pain 2: Zero-Signal Paralysis\n\nThe hardest thing about having zero users is not the revenue — it's the uncertainty. A product with zero users might be a brilliant product that nobody knows about, or it might be something nobody wants. The founder cannot know which until they get signal. But getting signal requires distribution. Distribution requires making decisions in a domain the founder doesn't understand. And so the founder waits.\n\nThis is a loop with no natural exit. The product gets better — new features, polished UI, improved onboarding — but zero users means zero signal means continued uncertainty means continued paralysis.\n\n**The real job to be done:** Break the loop. Get signal. Find out if this thing has legs — within 48 hours, not 6 months.\n\n### Pain 3: The Credibility Paradox\n\nReddit (and most communities where ICPs hang out) rewards authentic community members and punishes obvious self-promoters. The founder who posts \"check out my product\" gets downvoted. The founder who finds a thread where someone is asking exactly the question their product answers, writes a genuinely helpful response, and mentions their product in passing — that founder gets users.\n\nMost technical founders know this. They cannot execute it because:\n1. Finding the right thread requires 30-90 minutes of scrolling Reddit before finding something relevant (and often finding nothing)\n2. Writing a response that is genuinely helpful AND naturally introduces the product is a learned skill they don't have\n3. Even when they find the thread and draft something, the activation energy to hit \"submit\" is surprisingly high — \"what if this seems like spam?\"\n\n**Current solutions fail here:** ChatGPT can draft content but cannot find live, relevant threads in real-time. Reddit search is poor. Tools like Syften provide keyword alerts but don't help with content creation. ReplyAgent posts for you via managed accounts — which is spam, not authentic distribution.\n\n---\n\n## JTBD Statement\n\n**When I** have a shipped product sitting on a real domain with zero users, and I catch myself reading r/Entrepreneur for the third night in a row instead of actually telling anyone it exists,\n\n**I want to** get five ready-to-paste, genuinely helpful pieces of content placed in communities where someone is right now asking for exactly what I built — with specific thread links, platform-appropriate tone, and zero setup time on my part,\n\n**So I can** break the research loop, get real signal within 48 hours (did a stranger care?), and know whether this product has legs before I burn another month building in the dark.\n\n---\n\n## The Wedge\n\n**\"First 10 Users\" platform-agnostic launch sprint.**\n\nInput: product URL + one sentence about what it does.\n\nOutput: a 48-hour launch playbook with:\n- The 3-5 best channels for this specific product (not generic — based on what the product does, who it's for, and where that ICP actually hangs out)\n- Specific live threads or community moments where the founder can contribute\n- Ready-to-paste, platform-native content for each: sounds like a Redditor on Reddit, sounds like a builder on HN, sounds like a peer on Discord\n\nThe founder reviews it, edits anything that doesn't feel right, and executes the playbook. They don't post from managed accounts. They don't automate. They hit paste from their own profile.\n\n**Why \"launch sprint\" not \"distribution tool\":** The job is one-time. Getting your first 10 users is not an ongoing subscription — it's a discrete event. The founder who has zero users needs to know if their product has legs. One sprint, 48 hours, real signal. After that they either have users and a clearer picture of what distribution works, or they have kill data and can move on. Neither outcome benefits from a monthly subscription.\n\n---\n\n## Why Current Solutions Fail\n\n### ChatGPT + Manual (free — the real competitor)\n\nA technically sophisticated founder can approximate this workflow with ChatGPT for free. The gap between \"use ChatGPT\" and \"use this tool\" is real but narrow:\n\n- **ChatGPT cannot find live threads.** Its knowledge cutoff means it cannot search Reddit for posts from the past 7 days. The founder still has to manually find relevant threads — which is the hardest part. The tool can do this automatically.\n- **ChatGPT does not know subreddit norms.** r/SaaS, r/Entrepreneur, r/SideProject, r/startups all have distinct cultures, norms, and tolerance for self-promotion. Content that works on one gets downvoted on another. The tool is trained on what actually works in each community.\n- **ChatGPT requires prompting skill.** \"Write me a Reddit comment for a SaaS product\" produces generic garbage. \"Here is the thread, here is the product, write something that directly answers the OP's question in the tone of r/SaaS, mentions the product in the third paragraph, and avoids the phrase 'game-changer'\" produces something usable. The tool abstracts this prompting.\n\n**But the gap is narrow.** This is a genuine risk. The tool must be meaningfully better than a competent founder with a good ChatGPT prompt — not marginally better.\n\n### Reddit Marketing Tools (paid — the nominal competitors)\n\n**ReplyAgent / OGTool / CrowdReply:** These are spam machines. They post via managed karma accounts at scale ($3/comment or volume-based). The content is detectable. Reddit communities have become extremely good at identifying AI-generated promotional comments. These tools train communities to be hostile to any founder doing authentic outreach. They are the reason this is hard.\n\n**Redreach / SubredditSignals / Syften:** Monitoring and alerting tools. They find conversations but do not help with content creation or curation. The founder still has to figure out what to say.\n\n**GummySearch (dead, December 2025):** Shut down after Reddit revoked API access. 135,000 users. The right lesson is not \"this market is impossible\" — it's \"any tool that depends on Reddit API write access is existentially risky.\" This tool is clipboard-first by design.\n\n**Taplio / Postwise / Buffer:** Different problem. These serve brands and marketers who have audiences and are doing ongoing content publishing. Not relevant to a pre-revenue founder with zero users.\n\n### The \"Just Do It Manually\" Advice\n\nThe canonical response to \"I have no users\" on r/SaaS is \"just spend 2 hours a day on Reddit, answer questions, don't pitch.\" This advice is correct. It also requires:\n- 2 hours/day of unstructured time in communities with no clear output\n- Comfort with self-promotion and \"sales\" behavior\n- Sustained motivation without immediate feedback\n- Tolerance for ambiguity in an unfamiliar domain\n\nThe technical founder who is afraid to post once is not going to sustain 2 hours/day of community engagement. The advice is right but the execution path is wrong for this ICP.\n\n---\n\n## Evidence the Pain Is Real\n\n**Reddit threads (confirmed Feb 2026):**\n- r/Entrepreneur: \"Building the product was the easy part.

It's the workflow a competent technical founder already has for free:\n    64→\n    65→**ChatGPT + Manual Reddit:**\n    66→1. Manually search Reddit for relevant posts (20-60 minutes)\n    67→2. Ask ChatGPT: \"Write a helpful Reddit comment for this thread about [problem] that naturally mentions [my product]\"\n    68→3. Edit, post\n    69→\n    70→This is free. It works for founders who will actually do it. The tool must be meaningfully better than this — not marginally better.\n    71→\n    72→**Where the tool wins against free:**\n    73→- Real-time thread discovery (ChatGPT can't find posts from the last 7 days)\n    74→- Multi-channel coverage (not just Reddit — HN, Discord servers, niche forums)\n    75→- Subreddit-specific tone calibration (r/SaaS ≠ r/Entrepreneur ≠ r/startups)\n    76→- Reduced activation energy (30-second setup vs. 30-minute search)\n    77→- Multi-channel playbook structure (what to post where, in what order, over 48 hours)\n    78→\n    79→**Where free wins:** Zero cost. Full flexibility. No dependency on a third-party product.\n    80→\n    81→The tool's value proposition must survive the \"why not just use ChatGPT\" question. It does — but only if the thread discovery and multi-channel playbook are genuinely better than manual research.

A year of this data creates a feedback loop that a new entrant cannot replicate quickly.\n    94→- Community trust: if the tool's users consistently produce genuinely helpful content (not spam), and that becomes known in r/SaaS and Indie Hackers, the brand earns a trust premium.\n    95→- Dogfooding proof: if Kim demonstrably uses this to grow Get Just Go and publishes the results, that's unique evidence competitors cannot manufacture.\n    96→\n    97→**The honest assessment:** There is no strong moat at launch. The moat is built over time through results data and community trust. The barrier to entry is low.

This is not a nice-to-have — it is the go-to-market strategy.\n   106→\n   107→**Why this works:** A distribution tool that cannot distribute itself has no credibility. The first story this product needs to tell is: \"We used this tool to grow our own blog/product. Here's exactly what happened, with real numbers.\"\n   108→\n   109→Kim uses the manual version of the product on Get Just Go for 4 weeks before the product is built. Every post she makes, every thread she finds, every response she writes becomes:\n   110→1. Validation data (does this approach produce measurable results?)\n   111→2. Feature specification (what manual steps should the tool automate?)\n   112→3. Build-in-public content (post the results publicly as proof)\n   113→4. The product's first marketing story\n   114→\n   115→**The distribution irony addressed head-on:** How do you distribute a distribution tool with no audience? You distribute it the way the tool would — manually first, showing your work, building in public, letting the results speak. If the manual approach doesn't work for Kim, the tool doesn't work. That's a feature, not a bug: it's a cheap, fast way to validate the core premise before building anything.\n   116→\n   117→**Execution:**\n   118→- Weeks 1-4: Kim manually distributes Get Just Go blog using the exact workflow the product would automate. Documents every post, thread, response, and outcome.\n   119→- Weeks 5-8: Publish results publicly on r/SaaS, Indie Hackers, and r/buildinpublic. Show the numbers.

Nobody owns it. This is the genuine competitive gap.\n\nThe surrounding categories are:\n- Ongoing social media management (Buffer, Hootsuite, Postwise) — serves brands, not pre-revenue founders\n- Reddit marketing tools (ReplyAgent, Redreach, SubredditSignals) — spam-adjacent, Reddit API-dependent, broken by platform changes\n- AI content marketing (Sprites AI, Averi AI) — enterprise/funded startup tier, different ICP\n- LinkedIn automation (Taplio) — LinkedIn-only, wrong channel for most indie products\n\nNone of these compete with a one-time, multi-channel, clipboard-first launch sprint for technical founders. The closest competitors are managing ongoing Reddit marketing for businesses with established products and marketing budgets. We're solving a different, earlier problem.\n\n---\n\n### Direct Competitors (Reddit Marketing Tools)\n\nThese are the tools in our zip code. Most are structurally broken or serve a different job.\n\n| Tool | Model | Pricing | Status | Key Weakness |\n|------|-------|---------|--------|--------------|\n| **ReplyAgent** | Posts AI comments via managed karma accounts | $3/posted comment | Active | Comment spam factory. Detectable. Platform risk. Reddit ToS violation. |\n| **Redreach** | AI post discovery + reply suggestions | $19-29/mo | Active | Discovery only. No content creation beyond replies. Steep learning curve. |\n| **OGTool** | Keyword Reddit search + AI comment generation | ~$29-49/mo | Active | \"100-700 comments/month\" — mass spam, not authentic distribution |\n| **CrowdReply** | Managed Reddit commenting | Credit-based (~$200) | Active | Same model as ReplyAgent. Spam factory. |\n| **SubredditSignals** | Lead discovery + intent signals | ~$29-49/mo | Active | Monitoring only. No content. |\n| **Syften** | Keyword monitoring (Reddit, HN, Twitter) | $19.95-99.95/mo | Active | Alerts only. No creation. |\n| **F5Bot** | Reddit/HN keyword monitoring | Free | Active | Alerts only. No creation. No intelligence. |\n| **GummySearch** | Audience research + Reddit insights | $29/mo | **Dead (Dec 2025)** | Reddit revoked API access. 135K users. Gone. |\n\n**Key insight from the competitive landscape:** The tools that automate posting (ReplyAgent, OGTool, CrowdReply) are spam machines that rely on managed accounts and high-volume automated posting. This approach is:\n- Detectable by Reddit's anti-spam systems and by communities themselves\n- A ToS violation that can result in permanent bans\n- Reputationally damaging for founders who get caught\n- Existentially platform-dependent (same risk that killed GummySearch)\n\nThe tools that don't automate posting (Syften, SubredditSignals, F5Bot) are monitoring tools — they find conversations but don't help you contribute to them.\n\nThe gap: a tool that finds relevant live conversations AND helps you contribute something genuinely useful — not spam — is unoccupied.\n\n---\n\n### Adjacent Content Tools\n\nThese serve a different ICP (marketers, brands, established businesses) but compete for mindshare and budget in the \"AI marketing tools\" category.\n\n| Tool | What It Does | Pricing | Why It Doesn't Compete |\n|------|-------------|---------|------------------------|\n| **Taplio** | LinkedIn growth (AI posts, scheduling, analytics) | $32-149/mo | LinkedIn only. Built for creators/influencers with existing audiences. |\n| **Postwise** | AI social posts + scheduling, multi-platform | $37-59/mo | Generic content creation for established brands. Not builder-specific. |\n| **Buffer** | Social media scheduling | $6+/mo | No AI. Scheduling tool for existing content. |\n| **Sprites AI** | Multi-channel AI marketing agent | Funded ($4.45M, YC) | Enterprise/startup tier. Expensive. Overkill for indie founders. |\n| **Averi AI** | AI content marketing + human marketers | Undisclosed | Has 2,500 human marketers. Very different model and price point. |\n| **Letterdrop** | Content ops platform | $995/mo | Enterprise. Not our market. |\n\n---\n\n### The Real Competition: Free Alternatives\n\nThe most important competitor is not a product. It's the workflow a competent technical founder already has for free:\n\n**ChatGPT + Manual Reddit:**\n1. Manually search Reddit for relevant posts (20-60 minutes)\n2. Ask ChatGPT: \"Write a helpful Reddit comment for this thread about [problem] that naturally mentions [my product]\"\n3. Edit, post\n\nThis is free. It works for founders who will actually do it. The tool must be meaningfully better than this — not marginally better.\n\n**Where the tool wins against free:**\n- Real-time thread discovery (ChatGPT can't find posts from the last 7 days)\n- Multi-channel coverage (not just Reddit — HN, Discord servers, niche forums)\n- Subreddit-specific tone calibration (r/SaaS ≠ r/Entrepreneur ≠ r/startups)\n- Reduced activation energy (30-second setup vs. 30-minute search)\n- Multi-channel playbook structure (what to post where, in what order, over 48 hours)\n\n**Where free wins:** Zero cost. Full flexibility. No dependency on a third-party product.\n\nThe tool's value proposition must survive the \"why not just use ChatGPT\" question. It does — but only if the thread discovery and multi-channel playbook are genuinely better than manual research. That has to be demonstrated, not assumed.\n\n---\n\n### Competitive Moat Assessment\n\n**Not defensible:**\n- Content generation quality (every tool has this, and it commoditizes further every month)\n- Multi-channel reach (easy to replicate)\n- UI/UX (easy to copy)\n\n**Potentially defensible with time:**\n- Results data: which framings and channels converted for which product types. A year of this data creates a feedback loop that a new entrant cannot replicate quickly.\n- Community trust: if the tool's users consistently produce genuinely helpful content (not spam), and that becomes known in r/SaaS and Indie Hackers, the brand earns a trust premium.\n- Dogfooding proof: if Kim demonstrably uses this to grow Get Just Go and publishes the results, that's unique evidence competitors cannot manufacture.\n\n**The honest assessment:** There is no strong moat at launch. The moat is built over time through results data and community trust. The barrier to entry is low. Success depends on executing better than incumbents and moving fast enough to build a results database before competitors catch up.\n\n---\n\n## Distribution Strategy\n\n### Channel 1: Dogfooding (Primary)\n\nThe product distributes itself. This is not a nice-to-have — it is the go-to-market strategy.\n\n**Why this works:** A distribution tool that cannot distribute itself has no credibility. The first story this product needs to tell is: \"We used this tool to grow our own blog/product. Here's exactly what happened, with real numbers.\"\n\nKim uses the manual version of the product on Get Just Go for 4 weeks before the product is built. Every post she makes, every thread she finds, every response she writes becomes:\n1. Validation data (does this approach produce measurable results?)\n2. Feature specification (what manual steps should the tool automate?)\n3. Build-in-public content (post the results publicly as proof)\n4. The product's first marketing story\n\n**The distribution irony addressed head-on:** How do you distribute a distribution tool with no audience? You distribute it the way the tool would — manually first, showing your work, building in public, letting the results speak. If the manual approach doesn't work for Kim, the tool doesn't work. That's a feature, not a bug: it's a cheap, fast way to validate the core premise before building anything.\n\n**Execution:**\n- Weeks 1-4: Kim manually distributes Get Just Go blog using the exact workflow the product would automate. Documents every post, thread, response, and outcome.\n- Weeks 5-8: Publish results publicly on r/SaaS, Indie Hackers, and r/buildinpublic. Show the numbers. Start collecting interest from founders who want to beta test.\n- Weeks 9-12: Beta launch with founders from the build-in-public audience. Product eats its own cooking.\n\n### Channel 2: Community Content (Secondary)\n\nThe research evidence is clear: Reddit threads about \"how do I get first customers\" are the highest-intent entry point for this product's ICP. These threads appear constantly on r/SaaS, r/Entrepreneur, r/SideProject, and r/startups.\n\nAuthentic participation in these threads — not pitching the product, but sharing actual experience and findings from the dogfooding phase — is the second growth channel.\n\nEvidence that this works:\n- The $20k MRR founder built their business entirely through \"answer every relevant Reddit question\" strategy\n- \"Reddit threads rank on Google\" — SEO value compounds over time\n- \"Commenting has been way more effective than posting\" — the product's own core mechanic validated by practitioners\n- The Influx post (similar concept) got 118 beta testers from a single r/buildinpublic post\n\n**Rules for this channel:**\n- Zero product pitches in distribution-advice threads (this generates hostile responses)\n- Value-first: share data from the dogfooding phase\n- The product mention should be: \"I've been building something to automate this — happy to add you to the beta list if you're interested\"\n- Never link to a landing page in the thread; DM the founder directly\n\n### Channel 3: Indie Hackers (Secondary)\n\nIndie Hackers is the canonical \"build in public\" platform. A consistent build-in-public thread (weekly or biweekly updates with real metrics) builds an audience that converts to users at higher rates than cold traffic.\n\n**Target: 100-300 IH followers by month 3.** These are warm leads.\n\n### Channel 4: Product Hunt (Launch Credibility)\n\nUse Product Hunt as a one-day launch spike — not as a sustained growth channel. Only launch when:\n- The beta has 20+ active users\n- There are documented results (at least 3 founders who got real users from the tool)\n- The landing page is solid\n\nProduct Hunt drives press and credibility more than sustained user growth. Time the launch with a results story (\"I helped 20 founders get their first users in 48 hours\").\n\n### Channel 5: Directory Submissions (Low-effort, Long-tail)\n\nThere are 261+ free product directories and launch platforms (documented by a viral Indie Hackers post). A tool that helps founders submit to directories should be submitted to all of them. This is both SEO value and another dogfooding moment.\n\n**Effort:** 4-8 hours to submit. Long-tail SEO value compounds over 6-12 months.\n\n---\n\n## Revenue Model\n\n### Pricing: One-Time Sprint, Not Subscription\n\n**The core insight from Round 1:** Distribution for a launch is a burst activity, not a subscription activity. The founder who has zero users needs a sprint — a one-time, structured push to get signal. After that push, they either have users and a clearer distribution picture, or they have kill data. Neither outcome requires a monthly subscription.\n\nA subscription at $19-29/mo creates a churn problem: founders cancel after month 2 when they've either validated (mission accomplished) or given up (product is dead). The subscription model requires ongoing value justification that the product cannot provide.\n\n**One-time pricing:**\n- $49: \"First 10 Users\" sprint — product profiler + multi-channel playbook + 10 ready-to-paste content pieces, delivered once\n- $99: Sprint + 30-day support (\"I'll help you interpret the results and adjust the approach if needed\")\n\n**Why these price points:**\n- $49 is below the psychological threshold for \"is this a scam\"\n- $49 is viable for pre-revenue founders (they have almost no budget, but $49 is a realistic one-time experiment)\n- $99 adds the human element (Kim doing light coaching) which increases perceived value and validates the pain point with real conversations\n\n**The upgrade path (if recurring value is discovered):**\nIf users come back asking for more — \"that worked, I want to keep doing it for new channels\" — introduce a recurring tier:\n- $19/mo: ongoing distribution co-pilot (3-5 content pieces/week, channel monitoring)\n- $39/mo: multi-product, analytics, performance tracking\n\nBut do not build this until founders actually come back asking for it. Build what's needed, not what might be needed.\n\n---\n\n### Market Sizing\n\n**TAM:** AI social media tools market — $3.4B (2025), growing to $24.2B by 2034.

Mitigation: platform-agnostic architecture from day one; Reddit is one source, not the only source.\n","numLines":264,"startLine":1,"totalLines":264}}}
